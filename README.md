## Background
This SVG file used to be hosted by a link on the Shoryuken forums. Since the forums have been shutdown, it's difficult to find and share this file, which is the reason behind this repo. I had a copy from when I modded my F500 a few years ago, and decided it'd be nice to have it available to the public again.

## How to use
- Submit the SVG file to a company that can perform laser cutting (support local businesses!)
- Print to a thickness of 2mm
  - 3mm supposedly works but the panel might bulge out the top of the case a little bit. I printed at 2mm and it feels great.
- If using custom artwork, a nifty trick is to use the arcylic panel as a stencil over top of the art and cut out the button holes with an xacto knife
- Install an SOCD cleaner if you're interested in tournament play, the F500 doesn't support this by default

## Other requirements
- SOCD cleaner
  - Can be soldered to the connection where the USB cable gets power, or optionally crimped to that 5v wire
  - Example: https://imgur.com/a/KaUa7A1
- 11x24mm buttons
  - 3 for movement, 8 for the other face buttons
  - optionally 1 for the menu button, and 1x30mm for the up button
- Optional: custom art
- Optional: Neutrik USB passthrough
- Optional: Magicboots PS4 (will make the F500 compatible with PS5 native fighting games)
